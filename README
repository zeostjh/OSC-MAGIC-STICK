The purpose of this project is to create a magic wand. 
hardware consists of an ESP32, Digital Hall Effect sensor and 18" 3D printed stick.
The stick is wide on one end in order to embed the microcontroller and tapered 
on the other to house the hall effect sensor. When the Hall effect is activated within 
the magnetic field an OSC message is sent over wifi as the message =  /esp/ID_001/1   representing ON
                                                           message =  /esp/ID_001/0   representing OFF

These messages are to be send to TouchDesigner and or VVVV to effect generative GLSL projection maped onto an object.
