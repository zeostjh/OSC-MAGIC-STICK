The purpose of this project is to create a magic wand.
The hardware consists of an ESP32, Digital Hall Effect sensor and 18" 3D printed stick.
The stick is wide on one end in order to embed the microcontroller and tapered on the other to house the hall effect sensor. 
When the Hall effect is activated within the magnetic field 
an OSC message is sent over wifi as the message = /ESP/ID_001/1 representing ON 
                                        message = /ESP/ID_001/0
                                        
                                       
This data is sent to TouchDesigner and VVVV as control for generative graphics to be projection mapped onto a 3d object in phisical space
