The purpose of this project is to create a magic wand.
Hardware consists of an ESP32, Digital Hall Effect sensor and 18" 3D printed stick.
The stick is wide on one end in order to embed the microcontroller and tapered on the other 
to house the hall effect sensor. When the Hall effect is within close proximity magnetic field 
an OSC message is sent over wifi as the message = /ESP/ID_001/1 representing ON 
                                        message = /ESP/ID_001/0 representing OFF
                                        
OSC.h = single message OSC
OSC_Bundle.h = bundled OSC with add
MIDI_OSC_MUX.h =  is the same as OSC.h but enabled MIDI send note on/off over rtpMIDI 

The data is sent to TouchDesigner and VVVV as control for generative graphics to be projection mapped onto a 3d object in physical space
